# üëã Hello, I'm Emir √áaƒüan Beder!

**Data Analyst | International Relations Graduate**

I'm Emir √áaƒüan Beder, a Gazi University graduate in International Relations. My interest in software began during my sophomore year, leading me to complete Harvard University's Web Programming CS50 course. As I continued to expand my knowledge in both my academic field and software, I realized that data analysis was where my skills and passions intersected.

By combining the research techniques from my academic background with my growing expertise in data analysis, I found a unique way to approach data-driven challenges with a critical and comprehensive perspective.

## üîç What I Do
- **Data Tools:** CRM, Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, basic R, and Tableau, along with past experience in HTML and JavaScript.
- **Current Focus:** Sharpening my expertise in Python, Power BI, and SQL.

## üìä Projects
- WPS Index and Correlation Analysis with National Culinary Rating
I examined the correlation between the WPS (Women, Peace, and Security) Index, derived from
Georgetown Institute's 2023/2024 study on women's rights and security across various categories,
and the country cuisine ratings from TasteAtlas for 2023/2024. This project explored the connection
between countries' women's rights indexes and their relative culinary ratings.
- 23/24 Season Galatasaray-Fenerbah√ße Championship Competition Analysis
I analyzed the championship race between Galatasaray and Fenerbah√ße in the 23/24 season. I
evaluated whether Galatasaray's championship was an expected outcome based on statistical data
or a surprise, by comparing it to the performance and stats of all league teams. This study provides a
general overview of the season's dynamics and teams' playing styles focused on Galatasaray and
Fenerbah√ße.
- Correlation Between Ethnic Distribution and Crime Rates in the USA
In this study, I analyzed whether crime rates in the USA are primarily influenced by population density
or ethnic differences.
- Changes in TV Series Viewership Trends Throughout the Season
I researched whether the viewership rates of newly released TV series tend to decline after the first
episode or increase as the season progresses.
- Pens and Printers Company Sales Method Effectiveness Analysis
I analyzed the effectiveness of the sales methods used by a fictional company, Pens and Printers. This
capstone project evaluated whether the current methods led to time and capital loss and developed
and presented recommendations on more efficient sales strategies for the future.
- Other Projects: The Impact of F1 Car Size on Race Strategies | Correlation Analysis Between Income
Levels and Birth Rates | Comparison of Viewer Ratings for Old and New Movies | Statistical Analysis of
Sexual Crime Rates in Europe & Middle East | Popularity of Motorsports and Financial Investment
